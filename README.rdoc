created a basic form and lined everything together

made a landing page that directs user to form and index.

Going forward I will probably expand on this to just create a blog with posts and comments.

***I juschecked too see if it is working on heroku. My landing page is fine but the form page does not work.
Not sure what went wrong there. It works in my local host.
